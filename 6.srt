1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,505
I feel so good when I see you,

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,969
my heart feels that way,

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,725
but my head gets all confused.

4
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,852
I've always been...

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,316
bad luck for the other person.

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,343
Min Jae.

7
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,255
I'm closer to being bad luck incarnate

8
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,583
than good fortune.

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,001
Let's gather our bad luck together

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,086
and instead of seeking luck,

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,796
let's create some happiness.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,607
You just need to choose.

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,525
Is it Woo Hyuk

14
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,710
or me?

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,069
Geez,

16
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,780
you're joking in this situation.

17
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,157
It's you, of course.

18
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,961
My Min Jae cried and then laughed,

19
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
you look even cuter.

20
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,251
Min Jae.

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,829
Yeah?

22
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,485
Let's kiss.

23
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:27,841
"Blossom Campus"

24
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,147
(Chapter 6: So, what are we?)

25
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,384
- Have you worked at a café before?
- Yes.

26
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,924
I worked at one for about a year

27
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,471
when I was a freshman.

28
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,122
Ah, and thank you.

29
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,099
- For remembering and reaching out.
- You're welcome.

30
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,501
You seemed really desperate back then,

31
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,086
so I remembered you well.

32
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,961
And for such a good looking person

33
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:58,026
to come back,

34
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,323
I'm even more grateful.

35
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,510
So, you can make coffee...

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,487
Excellent.

37
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,746
Yes, you only need to

38
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,571
teach me how to bake cakes.

39
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,150
Well, Mr. Min Jae's appearance

40
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,182
is so great,

41
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,478
that might sell better than cakes.

42
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,206
However,

43
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,082
On weekdays, you have to study

44
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,965
and work at your university,

45
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,301
and our shop is very busy.

46
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:21,382
Can you handle it?

47
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:22,408
That's okay.

48
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm confident in my stamina.

49
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,635
Oh, great. So then,

50
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,902
you'll start working starting from

51
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:30,144
the upcoming weekend.

52
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,447
- Yes, boss.
- See you then.

53
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,966
Yes! Thank you!

54
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,231
Good morning!

55
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,525
Huh? Chan!

56
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,655
Thanks for coming.

57
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,449
Actually,

58
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,620
I was a bit scared to

59
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,928
open the shop alone.

60
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,745
Ah, stop exaggerating.

61
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,080
You got it done in the end.

62
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,792
But aren't you glad I came?

63
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,044
Of course, I am.

64
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,843
Just having you by my side

65
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:03,164
makes me feel so secure.

66
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,347
Order anything you want,

67
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:07,498
I'll help with everything.

68
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,035
Yeah.

69
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,974
You know I'm really grateful, right?

70
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,500
Come here.

71
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,521
The cake here is really delicious.

72
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,064
Chan!

73
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,858
You didn't eat breakfast, did you?

74
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,861
I saved a piece of cake for you.

75
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,654
Let's eat together.

76
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,906
I don't like sweet stuff.

77
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,618
Even this?

78
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,431
- Let's get to work.
- Sure.

79
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:02,610
I've decided,

80
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,830
but can I add a shot of liquor?

81
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,072
I don't think that's a good idea.

82
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,641
But I think it's fine.

83
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,306
But our shop doesn't

84
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,049
offer extra shots of liquor.

85
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,101
One cup, right?

86
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,580
Can I have a long black with

87
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:15,030
a cinnamon stick and apple juice?

88
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,389
That's this one.

89
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,849
It's just hot water added to it.

90
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,864
Ah.

91
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
Yoon Chan, this is my heart.

92
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,615
Here, eat.

93
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,946
No.

94
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,626
This is also my heart.

95
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,837
It's cute.

96
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,480
Don't put it there.

97
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,548
Put it back on.

98
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,882
Okay.

99
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,761
Enjoy your meal.

100
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,003
Yeah.

101
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,432
Serve them well.

102
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:07,471
Yeah.

103
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,366
Who ordered the latte?

104
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,833
Enjoy your drink.

105
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,182
Today was tough, huh?

106
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,318
It's very different from

107
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,023
when I am a customer.

108
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,408
Right?

109
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,911
There's more to working at a

110
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,669
cafépart time than you think.

111
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,654
You have to work in the café,

112
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,074
and serve the customers.

113
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,911
I've always played sports,

114
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,454
so my stamina supported me.

115
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,171
Being a librarian and

116
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,585
a weekend part-timer,

117
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,926
it's amazing how you don't collapse.

118
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,130
I get tired too.

119
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,077
But.

120
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,468
After living a difficult life

121
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,362
all this time, your endurance builds up.

122
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,922
I'm not too far behind you in stamina.

123
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,656
You've been through a lot.

124
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,282
Mr. Kim Min Jae.

125
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,100
I should probably catch up

126
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,186
on the dishes now.

127
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,868
You should take a break,

128
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:05,907
Mr. Kim Min Jae.

129
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,109
I'll do the dishes.

130
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,554
Sir, it's time to wake up,

131
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,764
Mr. Kim Min Jae.

132
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,731
Does my coffee taste better?

133
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,333
Shouldn't you be the one

134
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,427
working at the café?

135
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,321
Have you finished the dishes?

136
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,355
Of course. Who am I covering for?

137
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,662
I made sure to do everything perfectly

138
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,256
so you wouldn't get in trouble.

139
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,182
Then...

140
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,311
shall I go check whether

141
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,389
I'll get fired or not?

142
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,872
I already managed it, how was it?

143
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,536
Umm...

144
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,110
- Thanks.
- Really?

145
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,319
Did I do well?

146
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,813
You did great!

147
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,379
You did great too.

148
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,984
I have to hurry up and

149
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,148
make a lot of money,

150
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,889
so Min Jae will be more comfortable.

151
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,811
You can't even tie a ribbon properly.

152
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,948
Min Jae, did you know?

153
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,700
Your ribbon is a mess too!

154
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,487
Huh?

155
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,002
Turn around, I'll do it for you.

156
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,304
- Boss!
- Mmm.

157
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,793
Did you finish your business?

158
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,769
Yeah, I did. Who is this?

159
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,005
He's my best friend, Yoon Chan.

160
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,340
Ah, so this is your friend.

161
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,425
Nice to meet you.

162
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,969
- Hello, I'm Yoon Chan.
- Yes.

163
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,178
Wow, impressive.

164
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,931
Yoon Chan helped me a lot today.

165
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,307
Oh, I see.

166
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,392
Thank you so much.

167
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,810
Was it tough?

168
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,688
Oh, working at a café sure isn't easy.

169
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,023
But

170
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,984
it was fun working with Min Jae.

171
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,112
If you're okay with it...

172
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,573
how about working at the café too?

173
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,701
Together with Min Jae?

174
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,747
Sure, well, I'll get busier with work.

175
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,887
I was planning to hire

176
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:21,933
one more part-timer.

177
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,629
It'd be nice if we could work together.

178
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,508
That's a yes, right?

179
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,037
- Sure.
- Okay, you're so tall.

180
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,423
Very tall.

181
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:34,413
- I'm glad.
- Yeah.

182
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,991
Huh? What's this?

183
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,023
Ah.

184
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,872
Ham for the Budae jjigae.

185
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:02,319
- Ham?
- Yeah.

186
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,002
This is just regular sausage.

187
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,345
Oh, is it?

188
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,380
Can't it go in the Budae jjigae?

189
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
I like this sausage.

190
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,678
Everything you make tastes good.

191
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,468
But I'll dip this sausage in egg

192
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:20,491
and fry it for you.

193
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,267
What about the ham?

194
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,269
A Budae jjigae without ham is like

195
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,230
Kim Min Jae without Yoon Chan.

196
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
I'll go quickly and get some.

197
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,503
No, no.

198
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,171
I'll go and get it. You finish it, yeah?

199
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,325
Okay.

200
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,333
What's this?

201
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,092
Why did you follow me?

202
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,802
Because I was worried.

203
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,470
That you might use ham as an excuse

204
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,572
and go meet someone else.

205
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,639
Hey,

206
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,349
don't you dare.

207
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,664
Stop it.

208
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,108
- Stop it.
- No.

209
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,772
Stop it.

210
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,476
Wait for me!

211
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,016
Why are you here?

212
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:51,315
Your confused heart,

213
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,445
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

214
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:02,492
If you allow me for a moment,

215
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:07,623
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

216
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:13,128
A heart that drifts with the wind,

217
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:21,220
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

218
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,765
Your uncertain heart,

219
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:31,146
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

220
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,943
Putting an end to the waiting,

221
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,904
and stealing your heart away.

222
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,993
Without a word,
I shall take everything of yours

223
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,871
I'm almost going crazy

224
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:53,085
I can no longer stay still

225
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,589
I shall be the first to take leave.

226
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:02,135
Stepping forth to enfold your heart,

227
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,541
Dancing through the highs and lows tonight.

228
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,029
Hello, everyone!

229
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,197
I'm Kim Min Jae.

230
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,673
Shall we dive together into

231
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,345
the world of applied music?

232
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:26,994
The story of music and love,

233
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,371
and my determination.

234
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,248
I want everyone to watch it together.

235
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,589
Please give lots of love to

236
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,185
our show 'Blossom Campus',

237
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,420
And please love me, Min Jae, too.

238
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,380
Now then, goodbye.

239
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,799
Thank you.

240
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,637
Goodbye.

241
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,347
Hello, everyone.

242
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,558
Nice to meet you.

243
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,601
Isn't it time for Min Jae to come?

244
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,021
Ding-dong.

245
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,648
Chan!

246
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,442
Sorry for being late.

247
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,686
My part-time job ended late.

248
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,530
You worked hard today too, Min Jae.

249
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,532
I made a lot of money today.

250
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:07,480
Shall we properly greet

251
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,897
our audience again?

252
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:09,995
- Sure.
- Hello.

253
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,432
I'm actor Son Byeong Hoon,

254
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,520
who plays Min Jae in 'Blossom Campus.'

255
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:14,578
Nice to meet you.

256
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:15,924
Hello, I'm actor Choi Dong Ho,

257
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,237
who plays Yoon Chan.

258
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,297
How do you feel?

259
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,757
Honestly, before starting,

260
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,133
I thought, "Oh, it'll be okay."

261
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,552
"I'll do well." That's what I thought.

262
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,471
But now that I'm actually doing it,

263
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,473
I'm a bit nervous,

264
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,391
And it seems like I might make mistakes.

265
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,392
What did you do?

266
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,508
Just before I came here.

267
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,188
- You shouldn't have.
- My pronunciation got a bit messed up.

268
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,606
Ah, I see.

269
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,874
What about Min Jae?

270
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,860
Since I'm meeting new people,

271
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,571
I'm feeling very excited and happy.

272
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,989
You two match so well.

273
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,949
Do we?

274
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:50,510
Let's see for ourselves.

275
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,846
What was your motivation for

276
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,598
participating in 'Blossom Campus'?

277
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,447
I wanted to challenge myself in

278
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,267
a genre I've always wanted to try.

279
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,253
I had only played student roles before,

280
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,767
But this time, I got to play

281
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:04,232
the lead character for the first time.

282
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,752
As for me, I didn't have

283
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,693
any acting experience at all.

284
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,846
So when I first passed the audition,

285
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,306
it was amazing.

286
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:12,707
But I was very worried.

287
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,644
I was worried if I could do well.

288
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,003
You did well.

289
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,577
I thought, "There must be a reason

290
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,873
for being chosen,"

291
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,144
I decided to do my best.

292
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,210
So, I accepted it.

293
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,945
Did you imagine what BL series shooting

294
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,530
would be like before shooting?

295
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,952
Was there anything that surprised you

296
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:29,013
during BL shooting?

297
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,069
There wasn't anything

298
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:31,107
particularly surprising,

299
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,304
I had some idea of what

300
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,349
it'd be like beforehand.

301
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:34,413
It was really fun.

302
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,289
But one thing shocked me,

303
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,608
there's a scene where we were

304
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,643
doing a plane pose,

305
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,502
I was shocked by that.

306
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,462
I was a bit surprised by a scene,

307
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,868
it was originally a pecking scene,

308
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:44,923
but suddenly Yoon Chan

309
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,091
got really into it

310
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,634
and kissed me.

311
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,802
I was surprised then.

312
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,470
Since the camera was already rolling,

313
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,929
So it became a kissing scene.

314
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,476
- It's a behind-the-scene.
- A behind-the-scene.

315
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,499
Did you become close right away

316
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:58,329
during your first shoot?

317
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,882
Yes, we slept together right away

318
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,957
during our first shoot.

319
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,651
Yes, we slept in the same room,

320
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,361
we had no choice but to become close.

321
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,446
Before then, we weren't very close,

322
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,742
but after our first shoot,

323
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,384
We slept together in the same room,

324
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,742
so we talked a lot.

325
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,327
I think we became much closer then.

326
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,225
What is your favorite characteristic of

327
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:17,544
your fellow actor's character?

328
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:18,790
First, the face.

329
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,875
It's not a characteristic,

330
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,765
I like his face,

331
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,026
it's kind of tsundere.

332
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,837
I felt like he treated me well,

333
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,397
so I really liked that characteristic.

334
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,570
Thank you.

335
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,468
For me, it's Yoon Chan's physique.

336
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,723
Yoon Chan works out really hard,

337
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,808
so his body is really good.

338
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,128
How did you create chemistry

339
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,245
between you two?

340
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,521
Before shooting,

341
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,607
we joked around a lot

342
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,941
and played around a lot.

343
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,294
We also met outside separately

344
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,278
and had a lot of fun.

345
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:50,322
- That's right.
- We wanted to capture that feeling

346
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,845
during the shoot,

347
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,161
we tried to focus on loving each other.

348
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,412
So we kept meeting,

349
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,872
drinking together,

350
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,017
- and hanging out together.
- Right.

351
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,713
We went to Yoon Chan's house

352
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,097
together to sleep.

353
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,588
And then to my house to sleep.

354
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,694
How much do you empathize with

355
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,984
the characters in "Blossom Campus"?

356
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,470
I empathized and expressed

357
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,265
Min Jae's character's sad side.

358
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,559
Min Jae is really determined.

359
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,772
He leads a life of hardship.

360
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,317
He tries really hard to protect himself,

361
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,368
I felt like Yoon Chan's character is

362
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,336
tough on the outside, but he's a softie,

363
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,405
and he has no friends.

364
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,483
But when he talked to

365
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:34,601
Min Jae the first time,

366
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:37,264
he was really happy.

367
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,454
I don't know how to approach others,

368
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,100
so when someone approaches me first,

369
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:42,224
I get really happy.

370
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,060
I could relate to that a lot.

371
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:44,850
The charm of

372
00:25:44,866 --> 00:25:46,075
the other person's character?

373
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,587
Well, Yoon Chan's character

374
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,170
looks really cool and tall

375
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,233
on the outside,

376
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:51,900
but inside, he feels like a nerd.

377
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,596
Because he doesn't have many friends.

378
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:56,513
But I found that really charming.

379
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,911
At first, I thought Min Jae

380
00:25:58,935 --> 00:26:01,684
was just a pretty face and a stuck-up.

381
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,973
But as we got closer,

382
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:04,144
I realized it wasn't just that,

383
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,273
I found his personality really charming.

384
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,857
Min Jae...

385
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,110
Honestly,

386
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,695
he's not really that kind.

387
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,780
I mean, he's probably just

388
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:13,912
trying to protect himself,

389
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:15,890
since he has his own circumstances

390
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,514
and stuff, you know?

391
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,945
It seems to be a charm that is

392
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,382
only given to people he likes.

393
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,332
He's cold to others,

394
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,167
he only shows that side to Yoon Chan,

395
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,544
I found that really attractive.

396
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,337
The charm of Yoon Chan's character is

397
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,839
he only focuses on one person.

398
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,732
That's so attractive to me.

399
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:35,193
I like someone who likes only me.

400
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,257
Right.

401
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,764
Was it hard to portray the characters?

402
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,725
Or were you inspired

403
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,060
by other actors?

404
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,579
At first, it was really difficult.

405
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,888
Yoon Chan's character

406
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,561
transitions from being cold

407
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,568
to being really cheerful, right?

408
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,239
I didn't feel like I was

409
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:54,779
naturally that cheerful,

410
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,531
So I really thought

411
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,408
a lot about that part.

412
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,120
I studied "Choco Milk Shake" for that.

413
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,251
I watched it and thought,

414
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,540
"Maybe I should do it like this."

415
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:05,999
It should be helpful.

416
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,417
I think I pondered that a lot.

417
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,589
It was difficult to portray Min Jae...

418
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:13,442
Rather,

419
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,175
there were a lot of ambiguous aspects.

420
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,839
I tried to draw inspiration from

421
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:19,030
many characters in different works.

422
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,858
The work that inspired me the most was

423
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:22,033
"Semantic Error".

424
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,600
"Semantic Error," oh.

425
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,101
What's your favorite scene from it?

426
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,394
Please describe it briefly.

427
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,771
Tell us your favorite scene

428
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:28,998
in five characters.

429
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,231
"Café apron."

430
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,359
Does that make sense?

431
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,577
It's too suggestive.

432
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,031
Just now, it popped back into my head.

433
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,657
The cooking scene.

434
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,159
I really like that scene.

435
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,370
That scene was very sweet.

436
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,121
Did you ever feel fluttery

437
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,539
with another party while filming?

438
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,957
For me, it's the rooftop scene.

439
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,559
- The rooftop?
- Yes.

440
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,269
- The university rooftop?
- Yes.

441
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,712
For me, it's that scene,

442
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,214
when Min Jae took me to his house.

443
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,629
The character has

444
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:58,110
a self-defense instinct, right?

445
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,887
But letting me into his house,

446
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,731
the barrier breaks down

447
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:03,699
and he accepts me.

448
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,058
Isn't it just your own thoughts?

449
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,434
Is it?

450
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,870
I felt excited about that part.

451
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,230
If "Blossom Campus" continues

452
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:11,215
with another season,

453
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,208
would you appear again?

454
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,151
If Min Jae is in, then I'm in.

455
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,486
You won't do it if I'm not in?

456
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,737
Right.

457
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,822
Me too.

458
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,201
We've answered all the questions,

459
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,744
how does everyone feel?

460
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,143
We're really grateful for

461
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:27,639
the many questions.

462
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,869
Being able to talk with fans

463
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:30,059
even in this formal setting

464
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,126
is really wonderful.

465
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:33,169
- Right.
- And Min Jae?

466
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,547
This is the first time I'm filmed

467
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,298
with multiple cameras like this,

468
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,758
so it's really fascinating.

469
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,010
It's really fun,

470
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,502
but it's too bad, time flies so fast.

471
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:43,528
Right.

472
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,676
Even though it's been such

473
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,034
a short time today,

474
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,894
thank you for watching.

475
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,521
Thank you, everyone.

476
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,442
We're not sure if our Q&A was helpful,

477
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,651
but we hope it was.

478
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,903
Please love 'Blossom Campus, ' everyone.

479
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,182
If we get another chance,

480
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,424
I hope we can do this again.

481
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,705
It's not 'if we get' another chance,

482
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:03,592
it's 'we must.'

483
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,701
We'll meet again.

484
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,162
We'll just declare it

485
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,302
and the CEO will

486
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:11,099
inevitably provide it.

487
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,143
- We'll see you again!
- Let's meet again.

488
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,644
- We'll return!
- Goodbye!

489
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,958
We'll come again, everyone.

490
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,173
Goodbye, thank you for watching.
