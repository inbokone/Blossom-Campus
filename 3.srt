1
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,669
What was that just now?

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,092
Ah!

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,009
It's great to have a friend.

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,971
It's great.

5
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,695
Hey!

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,225
What was that kiss earlier about?

7
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,632
(Min Jae, do you want to
have dinner together?)

8
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,804
(Min Jae, what are you doing?
Let's hang out)

9
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,768
(Min Jae, today's lunch is bulgogi!)

10
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:09,951
"Blossom Campus"

11
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,134
(Chapter 3: I Keep Wanting to See You)

12
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,770
Are you very busy?

13
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,255
Oh! Professor.

14
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,183
It's been a while since we met,

15
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,709
can we have a chat?

16
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,068
Can we go talk somewhere else?

17
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,655
Ah... But it's about to get busy soon.

18
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,711
Min Jae!

19
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,186
Oh!

20
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,792
Hello, Professor.

21
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,128
- Who is this?
- I'm Min Jae's friend.

22
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,421
From the Taekwondo department.

23
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,797
Ah,

24
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,175
I heard that Min Jae made a friend,

25
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,634
so it's you.

26
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,057
Min Jae has told me a lot about you.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,768
Really? He didn't bad-mouth me, did he?

28
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,438
Geez, Professor...

29
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,749
You...

30
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,068
Can you cover for Min Jae for a bit?

31
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,111
It won't take long.

32
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,571
I just want to have a chat

33
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,115
with Min Jae outside for a bit.

34
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,576
Yes, don't worry.

35
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,829
Can you handle it?

36
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,248
Of course!

37
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,250
I've been watching you do it every day.

38
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,424
Handling your studies

39
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,969
and working at the library,

40
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,300
isn't it hard?

41
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,014
The schedule is tight,

42
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,332
but it's manageable.

43
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,913
Really?

44
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,747
Regardless, I'm grateful that

45
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,496
you've adapted so quickly.

46
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
At the beginning of the transfer,

47
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,238
you applied for counseling almost

48
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,337
every other day.

49
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,029
But after you've been busy,

50
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,864
we hardly met each other.

51
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,032
Was I like that?

52
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,536
Exactly.

53
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,981
It was nice to have someone to talk to.

54
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,583
But now, there's no one to talk to.

55
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,839
Professor.

56
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes?

57
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,482
How about I apply for

58
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,021
counseling again?

59
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,098
You little rascal.

60
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,699
You don't have to force yourself to make up

61
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:09,871
a story for counseling.

62
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,561
It's a real counseling session.

63
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,063
Oh, really?

64
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,232
Then, let's hear it.

65
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,167
Ah... You see...

66
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,592
We're definitely a friend...

67
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,515
Well...

68
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,567
Umm...

69
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,704
You're friends and?

70
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,383
Ah,

71
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,251
I don't know if it's right to have

72
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
these feelings for a friend.

73
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,797
What kind of feelings?

74
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,941
Well...

75
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,886
Logically, it seems wrong,

76
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,221
but my heart keeps

77
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,141
circling back to that person.

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,144
Really?

79
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,980
Does that mean...

80
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,524
you love this friend?

81
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,652
I'm not sure yet.

82
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,947
This is my first time feeling this way,

83
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,950
so I'm not sure if it's okay.

84
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,248
I've felt the same way before.

85
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,125
You did, Professor?

86
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,418
Yes.

87
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,147
Ummm...

88
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,715
In middle school,

89
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,717
around second year?

90
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,054
An older female cousin from Seoul

91
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,556
came to my hometown

92
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,477
to travel and rest up.

93
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,187
After school,

94
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,773
I would go to her and study.

95
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,111
It gave me a passion for studying,

96
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,696
Haa...

97
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,199
And that gave me a dream

98
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,575
of going to Seoul to study.

99
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,827
Mmm...

100
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,969
Huh?

101
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,871
Professor, aren't you from Seoul?

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,522
Right?

103
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,293
I appear like a local from Seoul.

104
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,711
Actually, my hometown is Miryang.

105
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,297
Now that you mention it,

106
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,882
I remember you saying

107
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,760
you had a tough time in Seoul.

108
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,055
Ah...

109
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,391
I came up to Seoul only for studying,

110
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,491
and from high school admission

111
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,679
to college graduation,

112
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,981
it was really tough.

113
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,602
You really went

114
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:24,307
through a lot, Professor.

115
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,115
So,

116
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,412
what happened to

117
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:31,795
your older female cousin?

118
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,431
Ah, right.

119
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,795
How did we end up with

120
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:38,936
you comforting me?

121
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,588
Haa...

122
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:49,343
The more time I spent with her,

123
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,597
the stranger my feelings became.

124
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,725
I kept

125
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,809
missing her,

126
00:07:58,364 --> 00:07:59,812
thinking about her constantly,

127
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,773
wanting to be with her,

128
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,220
but at the same time,

129
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,406
wondering if it was okay since

130
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,574
she was my cousin.

131
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,700
It was tough.

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,245
So, you loved your own cousin?

133
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,706
Hmm...

134
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,374
Love?

135
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,282
So, do you love that person

136
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,126
like that too?

137
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,464
Geez, what love?

138
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,133
What's with the surprise?

139
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:30,274
Is love a crime?

140
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,252
Yes. That's true.

141
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:35,014
Yeah, love itself isn't the issue.

142
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,519
But I'm not sure what my feelings

143
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,355
for that friend truly are.

144
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,490
Hmm... I felt the same way.

145
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,440
Back then,

146
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,775
I didn't even know

147
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,213
what those feelings were.

148
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,867
It took a long time for me

149
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,744
to understand them.

150
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,330
Time...

151
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:02,416
So, it took a lot of time.

152
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,587
In order to be sure of your feelings,

153
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,806
it takes a lot of time.

154
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,826
Of course,

155
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,637
everyone feels it at different paces,

156
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,724
so,

157
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,935
don't be too impatient.

158
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,937
There's no need to rush.

159
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,498
Yes.

160
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,656
Have a bit more trust

161
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,818
in yourself.

162
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,845
You're quite a good guy.

163
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,864
You can trust yourself.

164
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,700
Thank you, Professor.

165
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,439
Thanks to you, I feel like

166
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:39,181
I've understood something today.

167
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,524
Professor,

168
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,631
loving your cousin,

169
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,342
it wasn't wrong either.

170
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,321
I said that's correct.

171
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
No, click this and scroll down.

172
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,407
How can this be correct?

173
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,616
I said it's correct.

174
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,993
Ugh, I'm speechless.

175
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,220
- Dammit...
- No.

176
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,997
- Give it here.
- What?

177
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,557
- I'll do it.
- Hey!

178
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,916
What are you guys doing?

179
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,460
Min Jae!

180
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,933
You see,

181
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,713
I'm doing my job,

182
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
and he keeps interfering!

183
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,885
Interfering?

184
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,720
Because he's clumsy,

185
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,795
people were getting behind,

186
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:39,824
everyone was in a rush.

187
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,068
I thought it would turn

188
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,427
into chaos if I didn't help.

189
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:43,985
What?

190
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,369
I was just a bit slow.

191
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,063
Just a little slow, you know?

192
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,886
He just made things worse

193
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,174
by interfering.

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,543
Senior.

195
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,044
Why do you trust someone like him

196
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,326
to manage the library?

197
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,591
If you knew he almost destroyed

198
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,107
the library computer...

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,910
You'd have freaked out, wouldn't you?

200
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,329
No, I'm doing the right thing.

201
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,805
- Pull it up.
- I said no, that's not it.

202
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,082
Hey, gentlemen.

203
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,584
This is a library.

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,878
Please go outside and fight.

205
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
Why the formal language again...

206
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,926
Get out quickly.

207
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,430
Get out quickly!

208
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,748
Hurry.

209
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,316
- Go.
- But I...

210
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,195
Ugh, seriously.

211
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,992
(Library)

212
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,752
Anyway...

213
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,579
I understand that you were

214
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:55,665
trying to help,

215
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm sorry for snapping at you.

216
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,302
Ah, yeah.

217
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,597
I'll be off then.

218
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,166
Please wait.

219
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,166
Back then...

220
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,449
What did you talk about with

221
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,754
Senior Min Jae on the rooftop?

222
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,619
What was that just now?

223
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,088
Ah! It's great to have a friend.

224
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,876
What was that kiss earlier about?

225
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,974
Well...

226
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,513
Why did you ask?

227
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,895
Dammit...

228
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,905
Min Jae's lower classman...

229
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,200
Surely he didn't see anything, right?

230
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,702
Don't tell me

231
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,788
he saw...

232
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,999
That kiss with Min Jae.

233
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,829
Back then...

234
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,082
What did you talk about with

235
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,660
Senior Min Jae on the rooftop?

236
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:20,042
Min Jae's favorite drink!

237
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,777
Min Jae... Min Jae...

238
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,732
Right!

239
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,116
So what if he sees?

240
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,995
Friends can do that, right?

241
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,919
I'll give it to Min Jae.

242
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,313
Hey, Yoon Chan!

243
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:42,597
Senior.

244
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,321
What have you been saying

245
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,422
by yourself since earlier?

246
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,265
I'll drink this.

247
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,516
Thanks.

248
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,642
Umm... Wait.

249
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,031
What...

250
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,530
I'll give it to Min Jae.

251
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,555
This guy...

252
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,057
Alright, alright.

253
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,060
Yoon Chan, Min Jae, cross!

254
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,776
The dean is here right now.

255
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,993
I don't have time to play with you,

256
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,620
hurry up and go.

257
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,736
Haa...

258
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,933
Did I chase him away too coldly?

259
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,842
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,588
Did you wait for me all this time?

261
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,426
Ah... What, we can just meet tomorrow.

262
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,927
Why did you wait for me until now?

263
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,058
Right, we can meet tomorrow.

264
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,352
If not, the day after.

265
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,777
How much have I suffered because of you?

266
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,446
Huh? What did you say?

267
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,755
Geez!

268
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,048
Are you a kid or what?

269
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
That hurts!

270
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,802
Sorry.

271
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,399
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,973
I was busy today

273
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,975
and ended up being cold to you.

274
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,740
Today, I really miss you.

275
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,784
Yeah, I got it.

276
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,077
I got it, just let go for now.

277
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,636
Why did the dean come to the library?

278
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,762
Oh...

279
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,893
So that's why you were busy.

280
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,264
Today must have been tough.

281
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,599
Right?

282
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,309
Why did the dean come?

283
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,519
It's tough for Min Jae.

284
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,725
Chan.

285
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,122
Yeah?

286
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,690
One question at a time.

287
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,286
That way I can at least give you

288
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:31,177
some answers.

289
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm just curious.

290
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,030
What are you so curious about?

291
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,908
What are you doing right now?

292
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,035
Are you thinking about me too?

293
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,164
We're not in a romantic relationship,

294
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,582
why are you so curious?

295
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,226
Hey.

296
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,017
Isn't that something close friends

297
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,080
feel for each other?

298
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,592
Don't you like me?

299
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,470
Is it...

300
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,598
true that I like you too?

301
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,226
And more importantly,

302
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,521
you must not move forward alone.

303
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,267
Most importantly, how much do

304
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,745
the two of you share stories

305
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,360
with each other?

306
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,195
Your confusion might be because

307
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,411
you still haven't broken free

308
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,858
from the framework set by yourself.

309
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:21,660
Or someone else's frameworks

310
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,704
that are unnecessary.

311
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,654
That could be why

312
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,045
you're still struggling.

313
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,318
Huh?

314
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,053
Huh?

315
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,800
Where...

316
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,176
do you like me?

317
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,036
Where?

318
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:46,945
Your mind.

319
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,562
I like your mind the most.

320
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,470
Huh? I've always treated you

321
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:51,615
coldly though.

322
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,941
But you like my mind?

323
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,346
When I look at you,

324
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,362
I can see

325
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,363
what you really feel in your eyes.

326
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,994
No way.

327
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,826
How would you know my heart?

328
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,874
Your heart is beating so fast,
are you going to faint?

329
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,001
Do you like me that much?

330
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,579
Hey!

331
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,797
It's not like that!

332
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,157
Tell me why you're always

333
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,266
following me around!

334
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,813
Because when I look at you,

335
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,165
it's like looking at myself.

336
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,577
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,020
Are you saying we're similar?

338
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,632
Yes.

339
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,815
No way, that's crazy.

340
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,651
Even our personalities are different,

341
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,652
how could we be similar?

342
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,063
Well?

343
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:39,327
There have been times when

344
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:40,352
I've been like you too.

345
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,908
Because I don't always laugh every day,

346
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,703
and you're not always cold either.

347
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,805
What? What's gotten into you?

348
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,915
Why so serious?

349
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,041
What for?

350
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,918
You're way too serious.

351
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,169
Let's just go home.

352
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,295
Your home?

353
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,313
No.

354
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,756
You go to your dorm,

355
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,132
and I'll go to my place.

356
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,509
Okay, I'm off.

357
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,053
I want to visit Min Jae's place!

358
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,199
Go home and look in the mirror.

359
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,101
You and I are quite similar.

360
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:18,902
Your confused heart,

361
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:24,032
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

362
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:30,080
If you allow me for a moment,

363
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,210
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

364
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,716
A heart that drifts with the wind,

365
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:48,807
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

366
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,352
Your uncertain heart,

367
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:58,734
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

368
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,530
Putting an end to the waiting,

369
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,199
and stealing your heart away.

370
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,452
Hello, it's the youngest, Woo Hyuk.

371
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,328
Hello, it's Min Jae.

372
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,782
I'm really enjoying

373
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,487
my time with Woo Hyuk.

374
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,922
Because seems a bit rough

375
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:19,229
around the edges,

376
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,673
but sometimes he has a cute side.

377
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,258
So, time flies when we're together,

378
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,135
and we're having fun.

379
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,803
Umm...

380
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,070
Brother Min Jae, as you can see,

381
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:29,156
is obviously cool.

382
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,974
He has a good personality,

383
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,893
and he's good at singing, right?

384
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,077
Geez...

385
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,906
- You're awesome, right?
- Come on...

386
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,398
But why do you like me?

387
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Well...

388
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:41,793
Is there a reason for liking someone?

389
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,653
But... That guy...

390
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,116
What’s your relationship

391
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,335
with that tall guy?

392
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,116
We're just close friends.

393
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,403
Close friends that kiss?

394
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:51,836
How did you know about that?

395
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,542
Because I saw.

396
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,599
Huh? I don't think you did.

397
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,917
I know everything.

398
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,378
It's because you saw the preview.

399
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,309
Anyway, please look forward to

400
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,733
the chemistry between me and Woo Hyuk

401
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,053
in 'Blossom Campus',

402
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,697
please leave us a comment.

403
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,739
Yes.

404
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:11,815
Please enjoy it.

405
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:14,726
Yes! Thank you!

406
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,520
Please watch a lot!

407
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,021
Goodbye.
