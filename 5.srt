1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,887
It's a relief that he's gone, but

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,348
why does he keep popping into my head?

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,809
Get a grip, Kim Min Jae.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,352
Dammit...

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,105
This doesn't feel right.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,899
Who the heck is that guy anyway?

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,281
I think I got swayed by his eloquence.

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,142
Do you want to be friends?

9
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,622
In any case, he should've contacted me.

10
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:53,921
"Blossom Campus"

11
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:59,202
(Chapter 5: I'm Sorry and Thank You)

12
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,739
No, no.

13
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,157
Seriously.

14
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,326
I have to teach you everything

15
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,383
from scratch.

16
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,538
Yeah. This is better.

17
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:47,709
- Is this right?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,476
Good job.

19
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,296
Oh, this is good.

20
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,288
Good, right?

21
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,477
I'm hungry.

22
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,854
What should we eat?

23
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,947
What do you want to eat?

24
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,524
Min Jae.

25
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,499
I have something to say.

26
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,588
Woo Hyuk, go ahead first.

27
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:37,293
Yes, senior.

28
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,645
I'll wait in the club room.

29
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,230
You said you had something to say.

30
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,354
Min Jae, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,106
I know why you're upset, but

32
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,333
I just said that to the senior

33
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,388
to make an excuse.

34
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,043
So?

35
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,698
Is that a reason to treat me like this?

36
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,630
I just said it without thinking.

37
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,500
I was just expressing my thoughts.

38
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,794
So, don't worry about it.

39
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:15,014
How can I not worry

40
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:15,898
when you make that face?

41
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,215
Why do you care?

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,434
I'm just an ordinary friend

43
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,450
of yours, right?

44
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:23,596
No, I said that's not what I meant.

45
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,747
Just because you said no

46
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:25,708
and it'll be fine?

47
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,372
Those words you said so easily

48
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,505
without any concern.

49
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,859
Anyway...

50
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,869
I realized your thoughts are

51
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:42,221
very different from mine.

52
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,867
Of course, thoughts are different.

53
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,454
Isn't the point to adjust to

54
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,572
each other's differences?

55
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,334
Anyway...

56
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,046
Can't you just let this go?

57
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,853
Fine.

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,551
Just leave me and go as you said.

59
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,261
Then it'll be over.

60
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,934
Hey, Kim Min Jae!

61
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,233
Yoon Chan, why did you...

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,997
Not like this...

63
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,532
Am I being too narrow-minded?

64
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,534
(Yoon Chan)

65
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,412
Hello?

66
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,289
Min Jae.

67
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,999
- It's me.
- Yeah, I know.

68
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,179
Are you very sick?

69
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,908
What?

70
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,447
How did you know?

71
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,138
You haven't been at university

72
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,283
for two days.

73
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,022
I asked the professor.

74
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,277
Why? Did you think I died or something?

75
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:30,615
What are you saying?

76
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,515
I came because I was worried.

77
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,114
Huh?

78
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,592
You came?

79
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,671
Where?

80
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,789
In front of your house.

81
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,709
Who told you to come? Just go away!

82
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,252
Hey, Kim Min Jae.

83
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,878
Isn't this too much?

84
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,631
I even came all the way to your house.

85
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,379
And you tell me to go?

86
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,767
Damn it...

87
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,184
Look,

88
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,374
my condition is terrible right now,

89
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,752
can we talk here and then you leave?

90
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,255
First, take this.

91
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,013
Hey!

92
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,898
You're full of revenge aren't you?

93
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,549
Huh?

94
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,985
What?

95
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
I'm going to watch you finish

96
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,178
that bowl of porridge and I'll leave.

97
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,372
Fine.

98
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,129
So this is Kim Min Jae's place.

99
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,050
You've kept it pretty tidy.

100
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,993
Hey,

101
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,262
did you think I wouldn't keep it clean?

102
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,572
Right. Because you're Mr. Clean,

103
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,637
Kim Min Jae.

104
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,561
But right now it's a bit...

105
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,774
Messy?

106
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,009
It's because I've been sick

107
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,081
for two days.

108
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,947
I know, I know.

109
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,657
That's why I'm here.

110
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,632
Eat it before it gets cold.

111
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,768
What is it now?

112
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,439
Do you want me to feed you?

113
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,065
No, thanks.

114
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,716
It's creepy.

115
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,576
See, I told you I'd feed you.

116
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,707
Aah...

117
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,763
Hey, why are you eating my porridge?

118
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,028
I just took a bite to see

119
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,333
if it was good.

120
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,549
Geez.

121
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,769
No need, I'll eat it all myself.

122
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,313
You bought it after all.

123
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,740
Wow, you eat well!

124
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,242
See, you need me.

125
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,472
I'm eating it because you went through

126
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,714
the trouble of buying it.

127
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,560
See, you're still not fully recovered.

128
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,203
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

129
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,846
And

130
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,306
thank you

131
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,802
for having the courage to come.

132
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,075
Who's there?

133
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,610
It's Woo Hyuk, senior.

134
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:58,546
Senior, I brought some porridge,

135
00:14:58,554 --> 00:14:59,679
please have some.

136
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,030
Min Jae!

137
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,958
You're full, right?

138
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,376
He has already eaten

139
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,815
the porridge I bought.

140
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,622
Sorry.

141
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,128
I already ate the porridge Chan bought.

142
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,963
But thanks for bringing it.

143
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,068
I'll put it in the fridge

144
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:24,998
and eat it later.

145
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,755
Okay.

146
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,431
Should I put it in the fridge now?

147
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,435
I bought it,

148
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,895
so I'll put it away.

149
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,718
- Chan.
- Yeah?

150
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,863
Aren't you hungry?

151
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,742
I had some of your porridge earlier.

152
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,080
Hyuk, Hyuk,

153
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,731
aren't you hungry?

154
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,210
Shall we eat some porridge then?

155
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,802
See, you are hungry.

156
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,029
Yeah, a little.

157
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,894
Hey, you didn't act like this with me.

158
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,973
But in front of the senior,

159
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,121
you act all cutesy.

160
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,065
What did I do?

161
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,694
It's strange, really.

162
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,738
It's like you're discriminating.

163
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,172
What?

164
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,158
Why would I act cute with you?

165
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,242
See?

166
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,492
So, you were acting cute

167
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,641
in front of the senior!

168
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,753
Senior,

169
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,960
don't you find this strange?

170
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,886
It's really weird.

171
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,722
Why can't you just act normal?

172
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,198
Why do you turn into a baby

173
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,534
in front of Senior?

174
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,979
Because I like him!

175
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,036
Min... Min Jae.

176
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,205
I'm going to head out first.

177
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,667
I shouldn't be too late for the dorm.

178
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,153
Already?

179
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:09,622
Yeah, okay.

180
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,766
Hey, senior,

181
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,843
I like you a lot too,

182
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,532
but I don't act all cutesy

183
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:18,852
in front of you.

184
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,835
I don't think things

185
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,234
should turn out like this.

186
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,117
Yoon Chan.

187
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,494
Why did you come out when

188
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,869
you're still not feeling well?

189
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,948
Yoon Chan.

190
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,346
Yeah?

191
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,051
I...

192
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,740
feel anxious.

193
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,823
Why?

194
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,693
Because I don't know whether

195
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:25,802
it's okay to like you.

196
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,166
Why does that make you anxious

197
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,169
when I like you?

198
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,131
Because...

199
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
whenever I like someone,

200
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,890
they always leave.

201
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,477
Whenever I like someone,

202
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,422
something always happens

203
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:53,750
that makes them leave.

204
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,678
Min Jae.

205
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,330
I won't be like that.

206
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,002
Even if something happens,

207
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,839
I won't leave.

208
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,726
I feel so good when I see you,

209
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,148
my heart feels that way,

210
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,323
but my head gets all confused.

211
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,271
I've always been...

212
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,915
bad luck for the other person.

213
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,886
Min Jae.

214
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,207
I'm closer to being bad luck incarnate

215
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,473
instead of good fortune.

216
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,269
Let's gather our bad luck together

217
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,562
and instead of seeking luck,

218
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
let's create some happiness.

219
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,486
You trust me, right?

220
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,513
Min Jae.

221
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,628
You just need to choose.

222
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,547
Is it Woo Hyuk

223
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,718
or me?

224
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,633
Geez,

225
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,343
you're joking in this situation.

226
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,595
It's you, of course.

227
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,985
My Min Jae cried and then laughed,

228
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,583
you look even cuter.

229
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,244
Oh, you need to go back to the dorm.

230
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,846
Min Jae.

231
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,518
Yeah?

232
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,921
Kiss.

233
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:42,444
Your confused heart,

234
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:47,574
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

235
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:53,538
If you allow me for a moment,

236
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:58,835
I'll embrace you with my two arms

237
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:04,341
A heart that drifts with the wind,

238
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:12,349
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

239
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,894
Your uncertain heart,

240
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:22,943
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

241
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,953
Hello, I'm Min Jae.

242
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,340
And here is Yoon Chan,

243
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,161
who loves Taekwondo.

244
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,051
Yes, every moment with

245
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,867
Yoon Chan is so enjoyable.

246
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,496
My Yoon Chan is tall,

247
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,403
handsome, and dependable.

248
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,132
If there's one downside,

249
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,092
it's that he's a bit clumsy.

250
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,593
But that's my charm.

251
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,387
- Oh, really?
- Yes, that's right.

252
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,888
As for my Min Jae,

253
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,141
I'm happy with just being with him.

254
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,225
If you ask me why,

255
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,476
it's because of his music,

256
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,936
his gaze, his touch...

257
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,604
He's so warm.

258
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,273
And he's good-looking.

259
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,608
And he's so cold.

260
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,837
But still,

261
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,736
I like Min Jae.

262
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,690
I'm not cold.

263
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,042
- Is that so?
- Yes.

264
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,409
To Yoon Chan, I'm warm.

265
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,244
- You're warm? Really?
- Yes, of course.

266
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,328
Oh...

267
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:18,071
Please love Min Jae and Yoon Chan

268
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:20,242
of 'Blossom Campus' a lot.

269
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,586
Let's see each other often.

270
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,629
- See you often. Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

271
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,507
Goodbye.

272
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,559
Goodbye.

273
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,436
Goodbye.
