(Chapter 4: Just Ordinary Friends)

3
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,286
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

4
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:35,888
- Stop.
- Why?

5
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,896
- Hey.
- What?

6
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,903
I said I'm hungry.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,466
- Treat me to a meal.
- But you said that you'd treat me.

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,528
- You said you'd treat me.
- I have no money.

9
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:49,012
You said you'd treat me to

10
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,221
something delicious.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,582
Senior!

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,286
Thanks for bringing the equipment.

13
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,871
Ah, it was nothing.

14
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,373
Is this the location?

15
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,084
No, we have to go further up.

16
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,199
I look forward to working with you.

17
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm really glad I get to work

18
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,632
with you, senior.

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,689
So don't worry and use me

20
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,009
as much as you want.

21
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,762
Thank you for saying that.

22
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,389
Who would've thought?

23
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,510
We'd suddenly have to shoot

24
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,400
a music video.

25
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,601
Right?

26
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,413
The professor gave us assignments

27
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,694
without our input.

28
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,857
But I like it.

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,361
You're okay with anything I say.

30
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm fine with it.

31
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,417
It's a problem if you're

32
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,229
okay with anything.

33
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,157
Ah, I'm only like this with you, senior!

34
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,619
Shall we go up then?

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,737
Yes.

36
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,956
Do we go up there?

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,268
If we carry the luggage

38
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,995
and walk up there, we may die.

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,230
Just take the cart.

40
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,045
The cart?

41
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
Yeah, the cart.

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,561
- Let's go.
- Sure.

43
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,413
That's pretty over there.

44
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,815
Ah, yes, it's pretty.

45
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,591
Wow, as expected of Min Jae senior.

46
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,217
So cool.

47
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,696
Woo Hyuk.

48
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,072
Yes, yes!

49
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,588
Since you're also a key staff member

50
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:03,666
in this music video,

51
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,400
Your interpretation should be included.

52
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,916
Let's make sure to record

53
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,728
our interpretations for each scene.

54
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,316
- Yes, senior.
- Okay.

55
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,650
Here.

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,277
Here's good too.

57
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,279
Oh!

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,300
Woo Hyuk.

59
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,901
Let's listen and see if

60
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,190
it suits the atmosphere here.

61
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:40,570
- Is this your song?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:49,122
Your confused heart,

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,418
- can I perhaps look into it
- How is it?

64
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:54,227
- with my eyes?
- Oh...

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:05:00,216
If you allow me for a moment,

66
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:05,513
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

67
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,379
- A heart that drifts
- Woo Hyuk, want me to take a photo?

68
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,994
- with the wind...
- you'll get lots of likes on instagram.

69
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,278
- as if it's being swept away
- Sure.

70
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:19,002
- by the waves.
- Hold on.

71
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,572
Your uncertain heart,

72
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,258
- I want to reach out
- Woo Hyuk, one step to the right

73
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:29,650
and hold it tightly.

74
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,085
Pose more naturally.

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,587
Don't mind the camera.

76
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,554
Senior, this natural pose is

77
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:45,015
kind of difficult, isn't it?

78
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,138
Oh! It's good now!

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,578
If you pose naturally,

80
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:49,681
I'll take good shots.

81
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:19,796
(This morning's workout was so tough
Min Jae)

82
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,256
(Min Jae, what are you doing?)

83
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:27,178
(Hey...)

84
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,848
(Kim Min Jae)

85
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,275
Today was really nice.

86
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,810
Huh?

87
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,530
Ah, the music video!

88
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,468
I think this place is

89
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:48,577
perfect for shooting.

90
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,197
Right?

91
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,142
Look at this.

92
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,021
If the protagonist

93
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,090
walks through here,

94
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,395
it would be nice.

95
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,918
Oh!

96
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,154
Senior.

97
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,900
Are you planning to transfer to

98
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,080
the film department?

99
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,719
Hey, shooting a movie isn't easy.

100
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,640
Senior, hand it to me.

101
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,808
I'll hold onto it.

102
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,143
No need.

103
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,562
I used it, so I'll keep it.

104
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,406
When our professor

105
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,744
assigned us to make

106
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,449
a music video this time,

107
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,447
I was actually not okay

108
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:34,572
with it at first.

109
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,119
Do we really have to do this in

110
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:38,077
the Applied Music Department?

111
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,094
But

112
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,296
when I teamed up with you, senior,

113
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,047
and worked together,

114
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,718
I now understand why the professor

115
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,038
gave us a project like this.

116
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,890
At first, I...

117
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,067
was really worried about

118
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,638
how to shoot the music video.

119
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,565
But when the professor said.

120
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,479
That we would see the song we made

121
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,085
from a different perspective,

122
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,518
I'm starting to understand it

123
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:08,572
little by little.

124
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,760
And it would have been

125
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,050
impossible without you.

126
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,159
Thank you so much.

127
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,454
Right? You feel assured with me.

128
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,979
The face that senior not only

129
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,150
directed the music video

130
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,755
but also created a song,

131
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,215
I think it's really cool.

132
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,066
Oh, that's because

133
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:30,569
other teams didn't want to direct,

134
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,053
so I took charge.

135
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,137
Geez,

136
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,964
but ultimately, because you took charge,

137
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,394
it's turning out even better.

138
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,871
Thanks to you,

139
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,699
I'm learning a lot from you, senior.

140
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,982
I really want to worship you, you know?

141
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,675
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,379
I'm not God, okay?

143
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,073
Our relationship is equal.

144
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,950
Keep that in mind. Don't forget that.

145
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,534
Yes, I'll remember it.

146
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,789
The phrase "keep that in mind",

147
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,949
automatically creates

148
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,839
a hierarchical relationship.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,491
What a guy.

150
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,482
But, senior,

151
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,623
who will be the protagonist

152
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,693
of the music video?

153
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,865
Should we ask for help from

154
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,099
the Acting Department?

155
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,602
I've already chosen.

156
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,680
Huh?

157
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,689
Already?

158
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,301
Wow, as expected of the senior.

159
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,599
Amazing determination.

160
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,362
I decided just now.

161
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,155
Just now?

162
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,535
You've been with me all day today.

163
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,870
I wanted you to do it.

164
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,456
Huh? Me?

165
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,544
Ah, senior, how can I play the lead...

166
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,839
That doesn't make sense, senior.

167
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
Why not?

168
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,135
I saw earlier that you could do it well.

169
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,809
You know my song the best,

170
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,769
you've heard it a lot,

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,522
and you can express the emotions well.

172
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,858
But how can I...

173
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,504
Don't worry, I'll be by your side.

174
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,338
I believe you. You believe me.

175
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:16,713
It shouldn't be a problem.

176
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,836
I'll try.

177
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,675
Don't go back on your word.

178
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,243
And how long are you going to

179
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,564
keep calling me "senior"?

180
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,235
Being too polite can be

181
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:48,267
a bit uncomfortable.

182
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,946
Call me "older brother."

183
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,869
Yes, older brother.

184
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,862
Hey, Yoon Chan!

185
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,781
Yes, senior.

186
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,242
What have you been up to lately?

187
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,279
Huh?

188
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,037
What have you been doing

189
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,283
that you're not paying attention

190
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,257
to Taekwondo?

191
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:48,516
Senior.

192
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,835
I've never missed a workout.

193
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,106
Listen,

194
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,453
it's not about showing up

195
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,406
for the workout,

196
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,923
it's about the result.

197
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,805
It was clear that you practice

198
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,078
for the sake of practice.

199
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,011
Senior,

200
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,304
that's a misunderstanding.

201
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm really working hard.

202
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,574
Hey.

203
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,606
The guy who's working hard

204
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,775
is always hanging out

205
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,994
with that librarian?

206
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,229
Well, that's...

207
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,010
We're friends, so we hang out

208
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:12,958
after practice.

209
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,153
What friends...

210
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,944
You two were being lovey-dovey.

211
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,806
I don't know what you're

212
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:22,217
so preoccupied with right now,

213
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,243
but Taekwondo is your top priority!

214
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,061
Got it?

215
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,373
The competition is near,

216
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,333
and you're so preoccupied.

217
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,501
Yes, senior.

218
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,171
I'm always keeping it in mind.

219
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,919
But what's really going on

220
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,302
between you two?

221
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,446
Why?

222
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,014
Can't you tell me your relationship?

223
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,940
We're just friends.

224
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,058
Really?

225
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:00,729
Yes.

226
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,283
It's just a typical friendship.

227
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,677
Really?

228
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,229
Yoon Chan.

229
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,379
Stay focused until

230
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:19,816
the competition is over.

231
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,967
Yes, senior.

232
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,661
Min Jae!

233
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,798
Min Jae!

234
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,925
I called you, didn't you hear me?

235
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,651
What's wrong, Min Jae?

236
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,308
What's wrong?

237
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,651
Tell me, I'll take care of it.

238
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,481
Why are you acting like this today?

239
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,748
You're not usually like this.

240
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,419
Not like me?

241
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,975
Yeah.

242
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,633
I'm just like everyone else.

243
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,803
What do you mean?

244
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,536
I'm just being normal,

245
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:51,677
like our relationship.

246
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,159
Yes,

247
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:56,120
it's really just a typical friendship.

248
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,750
Min Jae!

249
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,319
Min Jae! Aren't we friends?

250
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,117
I never promised to be your friend.

251
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,091
Yes, come in.

252
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
Hello, Professor.

253
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,076
Huh?

254
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,769
Min Jae's friend, Yoon Chan?

255
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,646
Yes, that's right.

256
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,962
What brings a Taekwondo major to

257
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,235
the Applied Music Department?

258
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,267
I need some counseling

259
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,506
from the professor.

260
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,757
Oh, really?

261
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,075
Counseling with me?

262
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,218
Yes.

263
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,786
Min Jae told me that...

264
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,175
The professor is

265
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,766
a life counseling expert, he said.

266
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,333
Did our Min Jae say that?

267
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
Oh, that boy.

268
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,630
Come on, come and have a seat.

269
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,351
What's troubling you

270
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,483
to come to a professor from

271
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,295
another department for counseling.

272
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,044
You see,

273
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,446
we've met a few times, right?

274
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,990
Feel free to open up

275
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,369
and share your concerns.

276
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,500
Professor, do you know Min Jae well?

277
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,879
Um... I suppose so.

278
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,048
What kind of person is Min Jae?

279
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,469
What kind of person?

280
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,764
You seem quite close to him,

281
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,006
the closer you get,

282
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,131
the more curious you are about Min Jae.

283
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:41,704
Min Jae, he...

284
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,818
Although he looks a lot like me,

285
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,237
his personality is completely different,

286
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,156
so I really can't a prediction.

287
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,488
Right?

288
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,242
You can't make a prediction?

289
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,329
But you know,

290
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
we don't know ourselves well enough.

291
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,727
How can you expect to fully

292
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,311
understand the other person?

293
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,587
Unless you're a god, how could you?

294
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,444
But

295
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,383
most human relationships are

296
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,385
improvised.

297
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,932
Actually, I'm not good at improvisation.

298
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,726
According to Min Jae,

299
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,938
aren't you the type to always improvise?

300
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,149
Does Min Jae talk about me a lot?

301
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,776
Umm...

302
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
Min Jae is also...

303
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,563
not good at finding friends,

304
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:37,719
like you.

305
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,821
So he often shares

306
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,328
his inner thoughts with me.

307
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,906
Even though my actions seem spontaneous,

308
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,446
I actually always plan my actions

309
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:48,677
in my own way.

310
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,629
Especially with Min Jae.

311
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
Do you really like Min Jae a lot?

312
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,486
Excuse me?

313
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,722
Isn't that it?

314
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,940
Confusion is also part of the emotions.

315
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,943
It seems like Min Jae is like that too.

316
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,027
Min Jae too?

317
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,363
Even so, the good thing is

318
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,492
the two of you go well together.

319
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,828
Whether as friends

320
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,038
or with other feelings,

321
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,541
when you're together,

322
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,085
there can be complaints

323
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,045
and arguments.

324
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,932
But through that,

325
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,010
your relationship becomes stronger.

326
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,112
Min Jae doesn't have

327
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,920
many friends to begin with.

328
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,894
Just like you.

329
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,565
Min Jae has many aspects that are warm,

330
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,195
but he had to live his life on his own.

331
00:19:58,456 --> 00:19:59,518
So he has to hide

332
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:00,777
that gentleness inside,

333
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,493
and became cold on the outside.

334
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,456
Um...

335
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,624
In a way,

336
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,092
having friends might have seemed

337
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:12,797
like a luxury for him.

338
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,425
So having someone like me around

339
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,720
could have been burdensome for Min Jae.

340
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,555
Um...

341
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,390
At first, maybe.

342
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,601
But

343
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,897
since he started meeting you,

344
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,900
Min Jae himself

345
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,402
started to take off that cold mask

346
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
all by himself.

347
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,640
Autumn has already passed.

348
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,562
What is Min Jae doing now?

349
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,194
Should I apologize first?

350
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,905
Will Min Jae no longer be angry?

351
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,648
But does Min Jae truly

352
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,054
understand my feelings?

353
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,203
I'm the only one boiling inside.

354
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,832
No, no.

355
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,876
Still, I should apologize first.

356
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,340
Who is it?

357
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,800
It's Woo Hyuk.

358
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,594
I need to consult with the professor.

359
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,072
Hey.

360
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,474
Am I an applied music professor

361
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,518
or a philosophy professor?

362
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:04,156
Your confused heart,

363
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,286
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

364
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:15,334
If you allow me for a moment,

365
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,464
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

366
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:25,969
A heart that drifts with the wind,

367
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:34,061
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

368
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,606
Your uncertain heart,

369
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:43,987
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

370
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,784
Putting an end to the waiting,

371
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,453
and stealing your heart away.

372
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,788
Hello, everyone.

373
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,081
I'm Yoon Chan!

374
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,166
A college student who loves Taekwondo.

375
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:57,897
Let's fall into the charms of Taekwondo

376
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:59,309
and someone full of laughter and energy,

377
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,480
someone like me.

378
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,590
Of course,

379
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,062
I'll show you plenty of my clumsy side

380
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,518
and my smile too.

381
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,177
I'll show you everything I've got

382
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,721
so you can all smile.

383
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:10,982
Look forward to it!
