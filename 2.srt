00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,203
Hello, friend.

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,294
Yes?

4
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,338
Again.

5
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,549
Why so formal? We're friends.

6
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:55,113
Hey.

7
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,681
We're friends.

8
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,807
Friends.

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,565
Yeah.

10
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:00,727
Greet me.

11
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:01,809
Hello.

12
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,066
Excuse me.

13
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,695
Hello.

14
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,784
I'm looking for a book on

15
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:13,716
harmonic theory.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,241
Could you help me find it?

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,242
Sure, just a moment.

18
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,994
- Yes.
- Hey, you.

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,796
Yes?

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,209
Shouldn't we follow the order?

21
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,294
Oh, order?

22
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,224
I've been watching

23
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:29,482
from behind for a while,

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,560
it doesn't seem like you

25
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,788
came to borrow a book.

26
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm really here to borrow a book.

27
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,306
Stop! Stop!

28
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,392
Hey, gentlemen.

29
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,353
This is a library.

30
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,093
If you're here to borrow books,

31
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,366
please wait quietly,

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,275
If you're here to fight, please leave.

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,995
Check Zone 12-1.

34
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,983
Yes.

35
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,210
Senior, when are you going to help me

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,729
- with my guitar practice?
- Hmm, soon.

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,256
But first, find your book.

38
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,599
Yes.

39
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,388
Come in.

"Blossom Campus"

(Chapter 2: Can We Become Friends?)

42
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,020
When will this busy period end?

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,420
Huh?

44
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,560
I have to finish this by today.

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,811
Stop talking.

46
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,607
Fine.

47
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,400
But buy me tteokbokki.

48
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,029
You talk too much.

49
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,357
You know that, right?

50
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,740
I do.

51
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,008
You're aware but you still

52
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,149
bother me all day?

53
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,496
What? When did I bother you?

54
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,290
And besides,

55
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,584
we're friends, can't we chat?

56
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,420
I'm feeling bad now.

57
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,465
Oh, you're feeling bad?

58
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,343
But your friend is working hard.

59
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,678
And you're not even helping, huh?

60
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,527
Aren't you hungry?

61
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,112
How about instant noodles?

62
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,667
I want to eat fried food

63
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,277
in front of the university too.

64
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,995
How many words do you say in a day?

65
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,747
I'm busy right now.

66
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,208
- Let's go.
- No.

67
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,584
Huh? Let's go.

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,710
I said no.

69
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,462
Come on, I'll treat you.

70
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,134
Let's go, it's my treat.

71
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,302
I said no.

72
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,680
Please, I can't eat alone.

73
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:24,898
No.

74
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,642
I'll teach you, listen.

75
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,810
This is how it's done.

76
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,020
No, I did it properly earlier.

77
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,935
You asking for it?

78
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
Hey, Yoon Chan.

79
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,154
Why are you in there?

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,994
Uh... Well...

81
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,540
I'm here to borrow a book.

82
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,360
Yeah,

83
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,335
so why are you sitting on that side?

84
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,670
Oh...

85
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,631
Umm... He's my friend.

86
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,884
My friend.

87
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,922
Oh.

88
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,578
I requested to return it

89
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,655
through the app.

90
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,725
Yes.

91
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
It's done.

92
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,647
But are you two really friends?

93
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,667
Why?

94
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,710
Oh,

95
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,445
this guy doesn't have any friends,

96
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,477
it's the first time

97
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:22,704
I've seen him with someone.

98
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,663
Yes, we're friends.

99
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,460
I'm off.

100
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,348
Yes.

101
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,982
I said no.

102
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,360
Please, I can't eat alone.

103
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,153
- No.
- Let's go eat together.

104
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,487
Boo!

105
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,628
Be quiet.

106
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,768
Okay, I'll do it.

107
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,747
No need.

108
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,260
I said no need.

109
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,805
No need to help me.

110
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,482
What are you doing?

111
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,109
I said no.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,016
- Stop it.
- I don't want to.

113
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,746
The more you stop me, I more I want to.

114
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,661
What are you doing?

115
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,130
I said stop it.

116
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,935
Sorry.

117
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,305
See?

118
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,307
It's nice to have a tall friend, right?

119
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,439
Is it good or not?

120
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,882
Huh?

121
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,193
You're going to drop the book.

122
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,031
Why do you dislike expressing yourself

123
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,202
when you're happy?

124
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,945
By the way, do you

125
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,249
really have no friends?

126
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:39,045
I don't have any friends?

127
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,060
You're here!

128
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,711
No, not me.

129
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,214
Apart from me, is there anyone else?

130
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,463
Umm...

131
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,212
Yes.

132
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,051
Don't you think that's strange?

133
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,012
How can you have only one friend?

134
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,140
Yeah.

135
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,017
But is that weird?

136
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,602
You don't have any friends either.

137
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,313
I'm your only friend.

138
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,109
No, I intentionally don't make friends.

139
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,321
Umm...

140
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,787
I...

141
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,913
Just need one friend.

142
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,998
A real friend.

143
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,882
Don't do it.

144
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,342
I said don't do it.

145
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,814
Why?

146
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,132
Why did you hide?

147
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,385
Yeah. Why did we hide?

148
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,179
What?

149
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,265
Can't your junior

150
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,683
see us together?

151
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:03,477
How could we do that?

152
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,271
Never mind.

153
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:06,914
I have to work. Off you go.

154
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,079
Now!

155
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,910
(Private practice room)

156
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,932
You keep surprising people,

157
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,893
that's why you don't have any friends.

158
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,218
I told you I'm satisfied

159
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:41,351
with just one friend.

160
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,742
But why did you come all the way here

161
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,775
instead of going to the practice room?

162
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,522
It's a bit uncomfortable.

163
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,902
Yeah, the practice room was a bit small.

164
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,237
No.

165
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,947
That's not the reason.

166
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,971
It's uncomfortable and

167
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,213
things don't work out.

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,190
I thought getting some

169
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,330
fresh air might help.

170
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,228
Min Jae.

171
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,525
- Get up and come here.
- Why?

172
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,313
There's a better place for you

173
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,521
to practice guitar.

174
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,771
Let's go.

175
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,620
Min Jae, this way.

176
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,501
Isn't it nice?

177
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,211
This is the best view from our school.

178
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,571
Yeah.

179
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,740
It's nice indeed.

180
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,927
The atmosphere is great.

181
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,209
Can I request a song?

182
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,888
Mr. Composer?

183
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,316
No.

184
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,606
Just one song.

185
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,074
Huh?

186
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,684
Huh?

187
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,488
Alright.

188
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,741
Why are you like that?

189
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,402
Huh?

190
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,558
What?

191
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,931
Are you crying?

192
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,922
That's crazy.

193
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,548
Who's crying?

194
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,843
It's just touching.

195
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,431
It's like respect for art.

196
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,060
You're obviously crying.

197
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,598
Senior!

198
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,683
What are you doing here?

199
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,249
Guitar!

200
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,692
Practicing guitar.

201
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,775
But how did you know

202
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,480
about this place, Senior?

203
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,197
This is my practice hideout.

204
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,414
But Senior, you're too much.

205
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,585
You said you'd practice

206
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,624
guitar with me...

207
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,461
Ah, sorry.

208
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,581
Let's practice together next time.

209
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,846
I'll do it more often.

210
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,932
Umm... Woo Hyuk.

211
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,812
I have something serious to

212
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,274
discuss with this guy right now, so...

213
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,907
Ah,

214
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,780
you want me to leave.

215
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,470
Alright.

216
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,176
What was that just now?

217
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,613
Ah!

218
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,349
It's great to have a friend.

219
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,311
It's great.

220
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,038
Hey!

221
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,565
What was that kiss earlier about?

222
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,572
Min Jae!

223
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,324
Come quickly.

224
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,952
- Come quickly.
- I don't understand.

225
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,371
Why did I feel that way?

226
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:35,215
Your confused heart,

227
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:40,345
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

228
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:46,310
If you allow me for a moment,

229
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,607
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

230
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:57,112
A heart that drifts with the wind,

231
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:05,120
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

232
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,665
Your uncertain heart,

233
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:15,714
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

234
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,915
Hello.

235
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,768
I'm the youngest, Jeong Woo Hyuk.

236
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,416
The youngest and

237
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:30,954
the junior of Senior Min Jae.

238
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:31,893
What?

239
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,932
You don't believe that I'm the youngest?

240
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,952
But I am the youngest.

241
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,903
With a surprising charm

242
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,298
different from my appearance,

243
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,448
I'll captivate

244
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,951
Senior Min Jae and you guys.

245
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,994
Look forward to it.

246
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,914
Please love 'Blossom Campus' a lot.

247
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,088
Next, let me ask a question.

248
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,702
Oh, let me have some.

249
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,318
- Would you like some?
- Yes.

250
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,636
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

251
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,076
Is it tasty?

252
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,490
He was glaring at me earlier.

253
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,748
Scary.

254
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,643
Hmm, it's tasty!

255
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,078
It tastes better when someone feeds us.

256
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,277
It's an honor.

257
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:16,858
Wow. Fun.

258
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,983
Yeah.

259
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,330
It's so much fun.

260
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,921
Huh?

261
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,196
By any chance, are you

262
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,125
Yoon Chan and Min Jae from the drama?

263
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,785
Yes, that's us.

264
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,696
So nice to meet you.

265
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,721
May I shake hands with you?

266
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,913
Thank you, thank you.

267
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,999
What an amazing coincidence.

268
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,459
To watch "Blossom Campus"

269
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:35,038
in the same theater.

270
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,253
There are so many seats,

271
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,421
we ended up sitting together.

272
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,256
What an incredible coincidence.

273
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,340
Since we've met like this,

274
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:42,884
could we talk briefly about the drama?

275
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,433
Oh. Yes.

276
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,154
Thank you.

277
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,474
Could you briefly introduce your roles?

278
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,023
I'm Son Byeong Hoon,

279
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,954
I play Kim Min Jae's role,

280
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,523
Min Jae grew up in a poor environment

281
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,174
because he doesn't want to

282
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,330
seem pitiful to others,

283
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,988
he tries to act tough all by himself.

284
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,033
And he likes to act cold to others,

285
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,578
but he gradually warms up to Yoon Chan.

286
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,912
That's Min Jae's personality.

287
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,099
I'm Choi Dong Ho,

288
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:13,433
I play Yoon Chan's role.

289
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,684
Yoon Chan is lively

290
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,461
and has a quirky image.

291
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
He doesn't care much about others.

292
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,350
He only expresses his feelings

293
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,049
a lot to Min Jae.

294
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,558
I think fans would also be interested

295
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:24,694
in the actors themselves.

296
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,741
Min Jae and my personality

297
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,577
seem similar in some ways,

298
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,099
and not in other ways.

299
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,727
Compared to Yoon Chan's character,

300
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,287
I'm quite the opposite.

301
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,773
Yoon Chan is high-energy and lively,

302
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,566
while I'm not like that.

303
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,709
Really?

304
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,413
But I don't think the you I know

305
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,628
is like that.

306
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,999
Are there interesting or

307
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,374
memorable moments

308
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,341
from the filming so far?

309
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,951
Before going into standby,

310
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,162
I'd play jokes on purpose

311
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,497
to boost my energy.

312
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:55,061
It was fun when Min Jae

313
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,828
responded to my jokes.

314
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,914
- For example?
- For example,

315
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,630
I can't dance at all,

316
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,590
but I know just one move,

317
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,244
You know 'Super Shy' song?

318
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:07,177
When I do cute move like this,

319
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,721
Min Jae would do the rest of the moves.

320
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,612
Please show us.

321
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,183
- Please dance for us.
- You show it.

322
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,618
- You show it.
- What?

323
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,911
I already did it.

324
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,938
During the filming of this drama,

325
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,154
did you encounter any challenges

326
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,051
for the first time?

327
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,709
This is my first time doing this kind of acting,

328
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:24,337
although I've done other acting before.

329
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,686
In the past, I have played

330
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:26,787
hot-tempered roles

331
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:28,107
or villain roles.

332
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,412
But Yoon Chan's character

333
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:31,897
is very bright and lively,

334
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,788
I was a bit afraid and a little worried,

335
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,206
but Min Jae helped me through it.

336
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,918
As for me, I've only played

337
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,997
bright and lively roles,

338
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,105
a total opposite.

339
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,816
Compared to characters

340
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,597
I've played before,

341
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,509
Min Jae is quite colder.

342
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,844
It was refreshing.

343
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,603
During the filming,

344
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,214
how does the relationship between.

345
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:54,057
Min Jae and Yoon Chan unfold?

346
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,101
At first, it's like,

347
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,531
"Oh, this person exists."

348
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,728
It's not bad, that's how I feel.

349
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,309
But now, I'm trying to

350
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,639
appeal to Min Jae,

351
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,109
so I'm trying to establish my presence.

352
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,740
Min Jae has been curious about Yoon Chan

353
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,492
since they first met.

354
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,744
He didn't know what

355
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:14,948
emotion it was at first,

356
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:15,971
then he'll realize in

357
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:16,931
the second half of the story.

358
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,471
So in their relationship,

359
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:19,518
is there a part that

360
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,518
fans can look forward to?

361
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:21,963
Yoon Chan is

362
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,628
very aggressive.

363
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,718
- I'm too embarrassed to say.
- And Min Jae is...

364
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,593
- also aggressive as well.
- Right, right.

365
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,098
So it's like, "Look at them".

366
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,896
That kind of feeling.

367
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,826
The audience can look forward to

368
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,784
the latter part of the story.

369
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,098
Through filming this drama, what kind of

370
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,917
growth do both of you expect as actors?

371
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,067
Since this is my first shoot for

372
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,123
a this kind of show,

373
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,948
I might experience a lot of growth

374
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,535
because I have no experience on set.

375
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,455
As I accumulate experience,

376
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,749
in the future, I might become more

377
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,418
comfortable entering a scene.

378
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,369
Since it's my first lead role

379
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:06,394
in a drama,

380
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,002
I want to show a lot of acting skills

381
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:11,642
to the audience.

382
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,763
Is it progressing as you expected?

383
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,435
I'll work hard.

384
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:19,145
Then finally,

385
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,403
please tell us why we must

386
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:21,370
watch this drama.

387
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,729
"Blossom Campus"

388
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,939
I'm in it, so you have to watch it.

389
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,148
Hey! I was gonna say that!

390
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:30,278
Are you taking a test now?

391
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,338
No.

392
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,909
Because a handsome person is in it,

393
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:34,066
you have to watch it.

394
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,870
Our drama is a flower garden.

395
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,580
Thank you for talking with me today.

396
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,290
Oh, no problem.

397
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:44,009
I hope we will have

398
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,560
the opportunity to meet again.

399
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,562
- Especially at the theater.
- Oh! Sure.

400
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,172
You can leave first,

401
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,672
I'll sit here and enjoy the theater

402
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:51,930
for a bit before leaving.

403
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,418
It's over.

404
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,887
I need to feel this atmosphere.

405
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,138
You can leave first if you want.

406
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,406
- Thank you.
- See you later.

407
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,906
- Yes.
- Goodbye.

408
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,820
Let's go.
