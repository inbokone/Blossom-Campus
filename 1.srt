1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,462
(Hankuk University)

2
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,027
This isn't it either.

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,479
Excuse me.

4
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,844
Are you a student of this school?

5
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,492
Yes, why do you ask?

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,369
I was transferring credits to major in

7
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:37,722
applied music this semester.

8
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,994
Could you tell me where

9
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,299
the Arts and Culture Department

10
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,347
building is?

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,752
Oh, yes, just follow me.

12
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,294
Looks like you're having a hard time.

13
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,313
Here's the Arts and Culture Department.

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,911
Thank you.

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,006
What? Where did he go?

16
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,159
"Blossom Campus"

17
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,578
(Chapter 1: Repetition of coincidence is destiny!)

18
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,539
(Library)

19
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,240
Ah... Who put this there?

20
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,138
That student from before.

21
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,283
(The next day)

22
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh. You're here again.

23
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,217
We meet again.

24
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,424
The exam is coming up soon.

25
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,594
I'm not the type to really study,

26
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,179
but I still have to take the exam.

27
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,347
Ah, I see.

28
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,974
You can apply through the school app.

29
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,268
Ah, the app.

30
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,853
I'm more of an analog person.

31
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,898
Ah, I see.

32
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,441
Please show me your student ID.

33
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:05,620
Well... I didn't bring my student ID.

34
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
What? Why are you laughing?

35
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,501
Then please tell me your name.

36
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,543
You know your student number, right?

37
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,420
Of course! My name is Yoon Chan.

38
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,589
A one-syllable name?

39
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,383
Yes. Yoon Chan.

40
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
Everyone calls me 'Chan'.

41
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,763
(Yoon Chan)

42
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,123
- And your student number?
- My student number is 22016934.

43
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,987
The Taekwondo Department.

44
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,128
Are you in the Taekwondo Department?

45
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,398
Yes.

46
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,784
Umm...

47
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,847
Before you transferred to

48
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:46,955
the Cultural Arts Department,

49
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,621
what was your major?

50
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,164
Huh? Why?

51
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:52,979
Oh, it's nothing...

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,923
Last time you said

53
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:55,980
you transferred credits here,

54
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,142
so I thought we might be

55
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,009
in the same year.

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,342
Well, you know...

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,610
I thought it'd be nice to get to know

58
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,313
each other if we're the same age.

59
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,105
Do you always laugh that loudly?

60
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,181
Huh?

61
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,025
Since we're in the library,

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,277
could you lower your voice a bit?

63
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,324
Yes, you can take the books now.

64
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,584
Ah, okay.

65
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,292
I'm quite a good person, you know?

66
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,922
There's nothing to lose by

67
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:39,197
becoming friends, right?

68
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,986
Wait.

69
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,311
He'll probably return and take it.

70
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,293
How many times do you have to lose it

71
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,699
to write your name on your wallet?

72
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,047
I'd better go home.

73
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,527
He's really weird.

74
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,406
We won't meet again, right?

75
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,733
He's not the type to

76
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,795
come to the library.

77
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,548
I'm so hungry.

78
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,641
What should I eat?

79
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
Hey! What?

80
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,663
Why do you keep appearing?

81
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,072
Ugh... Creepy.

82
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,414
Strange. Am I seeing things?

83
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,752
This kid, why are you that surprised?

84
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,759
Are you unwell?

85
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,505
No, Professor.

86
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,645
I'm fine.

87
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,980
Oh. Let's introduce ourselves.

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,918
This is a new student in Applied Music,

89
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,143
Jeong Woo Hyuk.

90
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,652
And this is a senior in Applied Music,

91
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:38,676
Kim Min Jae.

92
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,145
Hello, senior!

93
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,396
I'm Jeong Woo Hyuk.

94
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,982
Hello. I'm Kim Min Jae.

95
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,568
Senior, feel free to speak casually.

96
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,905
Oh, yes. Take your time...

97
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,908
Is working in the library okay?

98
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,843
- Yes, it's fun.
- Really?

99
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,282
Thanks to you, I got a scholarship

100
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,125
while I get to work.

101
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,273
Thank you so much.

102
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,957
Working in the library,

103
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,858
collecting credits for your major,

104
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:04,002
isn't it hard?

105
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,128
Don't skip meals because you're busy.

106
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,838
Make sure you eat regularly.

107
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,923
Yes, Professor.

108
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,753
As you advised, I always make sure

109
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:11,943
to eat properly.

110
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,993
Really?

111
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,531
- But, Professor,
- Yes?

112
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,876
Is that student a repeater

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,267
or a transfer student?

114
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,185
No. Does he seems like it?

115
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,897
Yes, he seems much older than me.

116
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,609
No, he's a 19-year-old freshman.

117
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,244
Really?

118
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,157
That aside,

119
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,617
are you adapting to school?

120
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,952
Yes, a little.

121
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,350
The school is quite big,

122
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,039
so I haven't explored everything yet.

123
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,708
Really? Is there anyone bothering you?

124
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,668
But everyone's an adult, I guess not.

125
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,388
No, who would bother me?

126
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,622
And if they do,

127
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,341
I'm not the type to just sit still.

128
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,059
Alright then.

129
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,037
If you ever need counseling,

130
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,189
you know my door is always open, right?

131
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
Yes, Professor.

132
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,669
And it'd be good if

133
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,294
you could help Woo Hyuk out.

134
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,613
He's in a similar situation as you.

135
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,781
Get along well and help each other.

136
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,855
Yes.

137
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,033
Hey!

138
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,816
What are you doing?

139
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,931
Sorry, sorry, did I startle you?

140
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,192
We meet quite often, don't we?

141
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,646
They say repeated encounters
are pre-determined,

142
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,232
does that mean we're fated to be together?

143
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,360
Meeting this frequently means

144
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,627
our souls are compatible,

145
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:38,789
shall we be friends?

146
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,102
To be friends,

147
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:43,830
you have to start talking, right?

148
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,496
Okay?

149
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,680
Hmm, tasty.

150
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,056
What are you doing...

151
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,541
You don't have anyone to eat with?

152
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,477
Since we decided to be friends,

153
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,202
if you don't have anyone to eat with,

154
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,227
call me.

155
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,735
You see, I...

156
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,276
will make a good meal companion.

157
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,135
Who is this guy?

158
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,740
Since we're friends,

159
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,115
I'll give you a university tour anytime,

160
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,284
There's no place in the university

161
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,573
where I haven't been to.

162
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,158
He's really a strange guy.

163
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,349
Wake up, Kim Min Jae.

164
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,478
Your snacks are delicious.

165
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,356
It's not a snack, it's my lunch.

166
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,194
But I feel like I forgot something.

167
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,529
It feels a bit strange.

168
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,908
Ah, I don't know, I'll remember later.

169
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,830
I often forget and lose things.

170
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,680
Oh!

171
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,713
Your eyes

172
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,666
sparkle like the bus stop

173
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,111
in front of the university.

174
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,737
What?

175
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,306
Are my eyes like the bus stop?

176
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,124
Why?

177
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,144
I thought the lights on the bus stop

178
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,105
in front of the university were pretty.

179
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
Oh! I remember now.

180
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,680
Next time, I'll repay you

181
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:28,906
with something tastier.

182
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,258
I know a sandwich shop

183
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,547
that's even tastier.

184
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,342
Do as you like.

185
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,916
So, we'll see each other again?

186
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,796
So, we're actually friends, right?

187
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,340
Huh? Wait.

188
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,570
Seeing each other a few times

189
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,748
already makes us friends?

190
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,469
Oh, right, your wallet!

191
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,804
- You left your wallet.
- Oh!

192
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,598
I'm late, haa...

193
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,476
I'm late for the workout meet-up.

194
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,509
See you again, friend.

195
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,194
Haa...

196
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,831
As expected.

197
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,656
Strange.

198
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,325
Really strange.

199
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,128
Hello.

200
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,172
I'm Kim Min Jae, a librarian.

201
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,132
Do you know that you lost your wallet?

202
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009
It's at the library, come and get it.

203
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,972
His name is Kim Min Jae.

204
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,191
Even his name sounds cool.

205
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,331
Welcome.

206
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,399
We could've just met it at the library,

207
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,288
why come to the cafe?

208
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:12,513
Because I'm grateful.

209
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,473
I wanted to buy something tasty for you.

210
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,308
The cake here is really delicious.

211
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,896
But I don't have much time to stay here.

212
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,899
Ah, you're using polite speech again.

213
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,735
Where are you going again?

214
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,530
I'm not a person who gets along easily

215
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,765
with anyone like you.

216
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,783
And I have to go work part-time.

217
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,124
We get along since we're the same age.

218
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,452
What's so hard about it?

219
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,580
Excuse me.

220
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,478
Your coffee and strawberry sandwich

221
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:41,502
are here.

222
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,042
Enjoy your meal.

223
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,057
Here. Ahh...

224
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,451
- Wait, I'll eat by myself.
- Oh!

225
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,647
You're not using polite speech.

226
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,112
See! It's not that hard.

227
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
Come on.

228
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,831
Ahhh...

229
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,545
Ahhh...

230
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,836
Ahhh...

231
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,032
Umm...

232
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,253
Did you know you lost your wallet?

233
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,302
I'm just so used to losing things.

234
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,926
You're an athlete

235
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,363
but you're good at eating.

236
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,028
I exercise as much as I eat.

237
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,324
Ah. Should I teach you how to work out?

238
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,867
I don't have time for that.

239
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,287
And I'm not cut out for exercise.

240
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,331
So, I'll just show you.

241
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,377
I'm not really interested in exercising.

242
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,155
If you learn from me,

243
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,811
you might become interested.

244
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:16,595
I'll adjust the schedule.

245
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,308
Well, do as you like.

246
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,393
So, we'll see each other again?

247
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,941
So, we're really friends, right?

248
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,600
By the way...

249
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,115
Is it normal for you to become

250
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,209
close with just anyone?

251
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,616
I don't have many friends.

252
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,798
But I really want to

253
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,503
become close with you.

254
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,333
You...

255
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,169
Do you have a lot of friends?

256
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,591
Not really...

257
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,718
I'm just always working part-time.

258
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,967
Perfect!

259
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,222
We can see each other every day.

260
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,723
Every day?

261
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,017
I'm not that free.

262
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,770
I'll just come to the library.

263
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,480
A library isn't a place to hang out.

264
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,148
I'll go there to see you.

265
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,606
What's with suddenly

266
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,974
making friends like this?

267
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,356
Are you hungry?

268
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,943
I'll take you somewhere nice.

269
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,402
I owe you for eating

270
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,699
your sandwich last time.

271
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:23,918
It's okay, you don't have

272
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:24,988
to pay me back.

273
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,041
Just let me pay back. Okay?

274
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,294
Please don’t' refuse, let's go together.

275
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,796
Okay? Okay?

276
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,703
Yeah.

277
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,154
Let's go.

278
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,982
(Cafe "Bokeh" is hiring
part-timers, flexible hours.)

279
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,442
They're hiring part-timers?

280
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,360
Min Jae.

281
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,583
Min Jae.

282
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,736
Why aren't you coming?

283
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,116
Ah, I'm coming.

284
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,786
(Cafe "Bokeh" is hiring
part-timers, flexible hours.)

285
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,829
What a strange person.

286
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,049
Didn't we see each other several times?

287
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,158
Why the informal speech?

288
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,670
He's always asking to be friends.

289
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,901
I can't get used to it.

290
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,534
Ah, right.

291
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,892
I need to call the cafe owner.

292
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,230
Hello?

293
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,707
- Yes, hello, boss.
- Yes?

294
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,564
I'm the student who visited

295
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,656
the cafe around 6 p.m. earlier.

296
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,361
Ah,

297
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,744
the university student

298
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,769
who came with a friend, right?

299
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,326
Friend?

300
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,036
Ah, yes, that's right.

301
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,496
Actually,

302
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,091
I saw the job posting for

303
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,558
a part-time position at the cafe,

304
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,420
- Yes?
- I really want to do that job,

305
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,709
so I was wondering if

306
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,326
it would be okay for me to have

307
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:41,084
an interview for the job.

308
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,720
An interview? It's our pleasure.

309
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,014
How about this Wednesday at 7 p.m.?

310
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,432
Yes, thank you.

311
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,766
Then I'll see you on that day.

312
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,185
- Yes.
- Yes! Thank you, boss!

313
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,322
Yes!

314
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,700
I need to make money!

315
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,161
Yay!

316
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,040
I'll pass the job interview, right?

317
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,686
Your confused heart,

318
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,816
can I perhaps look into it with my eyes?

319
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:45,781
If you allow me for a moment,

320
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:51,078
I'll embrace you with my two arms.

321
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:56,583
A heart that drifts with the wind,

322
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:04,591
as if it's being swept away by the waves.

323
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,136
Your uncertain heart,

324
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:15,185
I want to reach out and hold it tightly.

325
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,445
Everyone,

326
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,306
I am a professor of Applied Music

327
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:29,470
at Hankuk University.

328
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,326
Now,

329
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,578
are you ready to embark on a journey

330
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,163
towards a deeper world?

331
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,041
Abandon the academic world

332
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,207
and come gain new knowledge

333
00:23:40,223 --> 00:23:42,604
and experiences with me

334
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,381
in a world that is deeper

335
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,299
and broader than before.

336
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,262
I will wait for everyone.

337
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,231
Please follow and support 'Blossom Campus'

338
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,599
Thank you.

339
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
Bye-bye.

340
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,435
I love you.
